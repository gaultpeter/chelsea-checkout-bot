# Chelsea checkout bot

Requirements: install all the requirements from the txt file, I recommend using pycharm for this

1. ./main.py - Add your customer ids as ints for example: customer_ids = [111111, 222222] in this array, get them from  here https://chelseafc.3ddigitalvenue.com/friends-family
2. ./resources/login_details.json - Update your username and password (email and password)
3. ./main.py - Set the number of checkouts you want to make per stand in the num_of_attempts, currently defaulted to 1
4. ./main.py - Set the event id, you can find this in the https://chelseafc.3ddigitalvenue.com/buy-tickets when the event appears, for example 1115 is for Chelsea vs Dortmund
